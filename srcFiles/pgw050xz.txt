The Project Gutenberg Etext of The 1913 Webster Unabridged Dictionary
******This file should be named pgw050xz.txt or pgw050xz.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, pgw051xz.txt

This etext was prepared by MICRA, INc. of Plainfield, NJ.  See below
for contact information.  Portions of the text have been proof-read 
and supplemented by volunteers, who have helped greatly to
improve the accuracy of this electronic version.

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do usually do NOT! keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

We need your donations more than ever!

tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon
     University" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution
you can think of.  Money should be paid to "Project Gutenberg
Association / Carnegie-Mellon University".

Note added April 2004:

The original files posted for the "PGW" files omitted the key
to the tags and entities used. These files are not standard HTML
or XML; they use conventions that had to be made up to fit all 
of the special cases found in the dictionary.

The following lists, from files originally named webfont.asc
and tagset.web, may be used to understand the markup. The
original text has been edited slightly for line-length and
paragraph clarity.

This file describes a modified font for use in visualizing the 
text of the 1913 "Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary"(W1913),
usable for the DOS operating system of IBM-compatible personal computers.
The electronic version of that dictionary and this font were prepared by
MICRA, Inc., Plainfield NJ, and are copyrighted (C) 1996 by MICRA, Inc.
For details of permissions and restrictions on using these files, see
the accompanying file "readme.web".

The special characters used in the electronic version of the Webster
1913 are required for visualizing unusual characters used in the
etymology and pronunciation fields of the dictionary, in a form
comparable to the way they appear in the original.  Since there are
more than 256 characters used in that dictionary, not all can be
represented by single-byte codes, and are instead represented by 
SGML-style "short-form" symbols.  (rather than the "entity" format 
"&xx;"  The ampersand is used frequently, and we prefer to leave
the "<" as the only "escape" character) of the type <x/ where x
is a specific code for the symbol in the dictionary. 

See the "Short Form" section below for details about such characters. 
Note that the symbols used here are in some cases abbreviations
(for compactness) of the ISO 8879 recommended symbols.  If necessary,
the table below allows simple replacement by alternate encodings.

This symbol font can be loaded in IBM-compatible (x86) computers
running the DOS operating system by using the "font.bat" command file
in the "utils" directory.  The fonts files for 8x14 and 8x16 fonts are
"web14.fnt" and "web16.fnt" respectively, in d:\webproof\fontedit
directory.

For those loading the Webster onto some machine other than an
IBM-compatible running DOS, it will be necessary to provide a
translation table, to convert these characters into a code that
can be handled by that computer.  For this reason, I attach an
"explanation" for each character, for those who cannot view
the original DOS font.

This loadable font does not contain all of the characters needed
to depict the etymologies.  In particular, no Greek letters are
included.  The Greek words appearing in the etymologies,
when they are included, will be typed in a
roman-letter transcription (See section on Greek transcription, below).
Only a very few Greek words have been thus transcribed as of the
present version (version 0.4).

Wherever the typists did not know the character to use, they
usually inserted a reverse-video question mark (decimal 176). 
This appears in full-ASCII versions as <?/.  This mark was used both for 
characters in non-ASCII fonts, and for unreadable characters (i.e.,
characters smeared in the original or distorted in the copies available
to the typists. The type in the original was in many places smeared and
illegible at the left and right page margins; occasionally, small
parts of words were blotted out by plain white space).

A character table for the high-order characters appears below.  
Under that is a list and description of most of the special characters
used in the Webster files.

Note that there are yet some characters used in the etymologies,
and some other symbols, which are not in this list.  For example, the 
vowels with a double dot *underneath*, e.g. a (as in all) have no
representation in this character set, and, where explicitly entered in the
dictionary, are represented by <xdd/ where "x" is the letter, as in "<add/".

DIACRITICS
-------------

The European grave and acute accents are represented by the 
standard (IBM PC) high-order codes.  Other characters with diacritics
are represented by special "entity" codes, and in some cases also
are found in this special WEB1913 font, described below.

Vowels with a circle above (as in Swedish) are coded <xring/
(x with a ring, or "degrees" mark over it); vowels with tilde over them
are represented by <xtil/, where "x" is the vowel, as in <etil/ (<atil/
also has code 238); letters with a dot above are represented by <xdot/
-- letter with a dot below are represented by <xsdot/ ("subdot");
vowels with the semi-long mark (a macron with a short perpendicular
vertical stroke attached above) are represented by <xsl/; the
circumflex vowels have codes on this list, but may also be represented
as <xcir/; vowels with macrons above are <xmac/ (including <oomac/,
the "oo" with an unbroken macron above the two letters, <aemac/ = the
ligature ae with a macron [also 214 = \'d6], and <oemac/ the ligature
oe with a macron [also 215 = \'d7]); vowels with umlauts or a crescent
(breve) above have codes in this list, but may also be represented by
<xum/ and <xcr/ respectively.  There is an occasional hacek or caron mark
(an inverted circumflex) in the original; such letters are coded <xcar/.
The o with a caron has code 213, but no others are in this font list.
The diaeresis is treated typographically as identical to the umlaut.  

A special modification, used only for poetry (see entry "saturnian
verse" under "saturnian") is a vowel with a macron, in which the macron
is lighter than the usual macron, signifying a stressed syllable which
has a short vowel sound. This is represented by <xsmac/ ("short mac").

Another special character used in pronunciations is an "n" with an
underline (like a macron, but below the letter), used to represent the
"ng" sound. This is coded <nsm/ ("n sub-macron"). The ligated th used in
pronunciations to depict the "th" sound of "the" is coded as <th/.

NOTE: the letter combinations "fi" and "fl" are invariably printed as the
ligatures <filig/ and <fllig/, but these ligatures are not marked as such
in this transcription, and the two letters are left as individuals.

An occasional symbol may be used with a normal letter inverted
(upside down) or reversed (mirrored left-to-right).  These are 
symbolized as <Crev/ (for capital C reversed) and <Uinv/ (for capital
U inverted), etc.

SPECIAL SYMBOLS

The dagger <dag/, double dagger <ddag/, and paragraph mark <para/ are
rarely used. The double prime, or "seconds" of a degree is sometimes
represented by a double "light accent" (code 183 = \'b7). In other
places, it is represented by <sec/.

The symbols "greater than" <gt/ and "less than" are encountered only once,
but are distinguished from the right- and left-angle brackets (> and <)
because of possible typograhical differences in some fonts.

               will fuse with left long dash, char 208
  196    c4      Ä     graphic horizontal line
  195+208        ÃÐ     combination for a very long dash.  In the 
            original typing, the dash char 208 was used
            for both non-breaking hyphen (in hyphenated
            words), and for the em-dash used as an
            introductory mark for various segments.
            The em-dash should be distinguished from 
            the hyphen, but that conversion hasn't yet
            been done.
             In the full ASCII version, a double hypen
            "--" represent the m-dash
  197    c5      Å     <sect/ = section mark
               - alternate to 21 (a control character)

  203            Ë     <ecr/ = e with crescent (breve) above.  Used
            - in some etymologies and pronunciation
  204            Ì     <icr/ = i with crescent (breve) above - used

  206            Î     <ocr/ = o with crescent (breve) above - used 
            - in some etymologies and pronunciation
  207            Ï     short dash, used in hyphenated words, and in
             breaking syllables where no accent is used. But
             sometimes the typists used the normal hyphen [45],
             or the long dash (decimal 208) for that purpose.
             The normal hyphen is the same length as the long
             dash, but one pixel higher in the character box.
             # In headwords, in the full ASCII version, this
             short dash is represented by the asterisk "*".
  208    d0      Ð     <mdash/ = long dash, used for the em dash which 
             often precedes certain sections within a
             definition, and which separates some sectrions,
             such as wordforms or collocations within a
             collocation segment.  This is replaced in the 
             full ASCII version by a double hyphen, "--"
  210    d2      Ò     <oe/ = "oe" fused ligature
  211    d3      Ó     <omac/ = o macron
  212    d4      Ô     <umac/ = u macron

  214            Ö     <aemac/ = "ae" ligature with a macron
  215            ×     <oemac/ = "oe" ligature with a macron
  216    d8      Ø     <par/ double vertical bar (short length; the long
               length is the graphics character 186)
               This precedes words marked with a double vertical bar in
               the original dictionary, signifying that the word was
               adopted directly into English without modification of
               the spelling.
  220            Ü     <ucr/ = u with crescent above - used in some etymologies
  221            Ý     <acr/ = a with crescent above - used in some etymologies
  222            Þ     <cre/ = "crescent", an upward-curving crescent
            used as a poetic meter mark
  223            ß     <ymac/ = y macron (used in Anglo-Saxon)
  235            ë     <edh/ = Old English and Icelandic "edh", (or "eth")
            like a Greek delta with a hatch mark 
            through the ascender. Used to represent the
            Anglo-Saxon/Icelandic/Gothic character,
            in etymologies, pronounced like "th"
  235            í     <thorn/ "thorn", an Old English and Icelandic
            character, appears like a "p" with an extended
            ascender.
            Used to represent the
            Anglo-Saxon/Icelandic/Gothic character,
            in etymologies, pronounced like "th"
            in "brother"
  238            î     <atil/ a with tilde above - in some etymologies
  244    f4      ô     like a script "3" or "z". Used in Old English
               etymologies, analogous to "y" 
  247    f7      ÷     double tilde ("approximately equals").
               used by typists as a place-holder in word 
             combinations where the capitalized headword
             should be.
  248    f8      ø     <deg/ degrees (temperature or angle).  Note: some
              typists used a superscript "o" to signify
              degrees.  This must be corrected!
  249    f9      ù     middle dot (bold)
  250    fa      ú     middle dot (light)
  251    fb      û     <root/ "root" sign used in etymologies, as in original                  
  


======================================
   Greek transcription
=====================================
Greek letters are represented:
   (capitals represent capital letters; lower-case represent lower-case)
   #Note that "h" in transliterations is used individually, as eta, and
   also in the combination "ch" (chi).  Conversions to other codings
   must first convert "ch" before converting "h", or at least verify
   that an "h" to be converted has no preceding "c".  "c" is not
   otherwise used, so there is no ambiguity.  Also, "ps" always 
   represents a psi; it could in theory occur as a pi-sigma
   combination, but it doesn't.  Occasionally, "th" was entered instead
   of "q" to represent theta; these should be checked to verify that
   they do not represent tau-eta, and converted to "q".

(1) characters individually:
  By the short-form notation <alpha/, <beta/, <gamma/, <lambda/ etc.
  Capitalized letters are <ALPHA/, etc.
(2) in words:
 By inclusion within the markers <grk></grk>, using the following
  roman-letter equivalents for the Greek letters:
   Accents:
     (a) initial aspirants -- used only in front of words beginning in
     vowels, of two types
      ' (apostrophe) for the left-curving apirant
      " (double quote) for the right-curving aspirant
     (b) normal accent:
      `  (left open quote, ASCII ) -- placed after accented vowel
     (c) curving accent (appearing as a rounded circumflex):
      ^  (circumflex) -- placed after accented vowel
     (d) "iota" subscript (ogonek)-- a comma placed after the vowel
           having the subscript
     Where a letter has two accents, both are placed after the vowel
     Initial letters with an aspirant and an accent have the
     aspirant before the letter, and the accent after it.

     Explanations of the tags used to mark the Webster's Unabriged.
     For a complete list of the tags and their occurrence count,
          see file "webtags.lst"
     If any tag is not listed here, it is either (1) one of the 
        "point" or "type" tags, which should be self-explanatory; or
        (2) Is a functional field with no effect on the typography.

-------------------------------------------------------------
A separate file, entities.web, contain the list of the individual non-ASCII
characters represented by either higher-order
hexadecimal character marks (e.g., \'94, for o-umlaut) or by entity tags
(e.g., <root/, for the square root symbol.)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The tags on this list are similar in structure to SGML tags.  Each
tag on this list  marks a field; each field opens with a tagname between
angle brackets thus: <tagname>, and closes with a similar tag containing
the forward slash thus: </tagname>.

The absence of an end-field tag, or the presence of an end-field tag
without a prior begin-field tag constitutes a typographical error, of which
there may be a significant number.  Any errors detected should be brought
to the attention of PC.

Most of the tags are represented in the text by italic type, with a
number of exceptions.  Where a word is contained within more than one
field, the innermost field determines the font to be used.  Wherever
recognizable functional fields were found, an attempt was made to tag the
field with a functional mark, but in many cases, words were italicised only
to represent the word itself as a discourse entity, and in some such cases,
the "italic" mark <it> was used, implying nothing regarding functionality
of the word.  The base font is considered "plain".  Where an italic field
is indicated, parentheses or brackets within the field are not italicised.

Where no font is specified for a tag, the tag is merely a functional
division, and was printed in plain font.  This is
marked by an asterisk (*).

The size of the "plain" font is about 1.6 mm for the height of
capitalized letters.

=============================================================
Explicit typographical tags:
   These were used where the purpose of a different font was merely to
distinguish a word from the body of the text, and no explicit functional
tag seemed apropriate.
-----------------------------------
Tag        Font
-----------------------------------
<plain>    plain font (that used in the body of a definition) --
              normally not marked, except within fields of
              a different front.
<it>       italic
<bold>     bold
<sc>       small caps    (used mostly for "a. d.",  "b. c.")
<universbold>  A squared bold font approximating the "universe bold"
               font on the HP Laserjet4, slightly larger than
               the capitals in a definition body.  Used in expositions
               describing shapes, such as "Y", "T", "U", "X", "V".
<hwf>      Font the same as the headword <hw>, though the field is
                 not a headword.  Used only once.
<subs>      subscript
<sups>      superscript
<supr>      superscript
<...type>   A series of tags, many unique, designating certain
              unusual fonts, such as "bourgeoistype" for
              "bourgeois type", in the section on typography.
<sansserif> Sans-serif font
<point ...> A series of point size markers, many unique.
<vertical>  Vertically organized column.
<column1>   Vertically organized column -- only part of a table
              which needs to be completed.  Used once.
=============================================================
Explicit formatting tags:
<au> preceded by two paragraph marks (carriage returns).
            Not otherwise marked, but can be done automatically
               if needed.
            These "authority" fields are right-justified, and
            usually fit on the same line as the last segment of the
            preceding definition or quotation.  When they don't
            fit on the last line, they are right-justified on a
            line of their own.
<qau>       Always right-justified, as described for <au>.
<centered>  Used only for The single letter in the headers to each
            letter of the alphabet.
<rj>        Right justified
<row>       Designates a row in a table.
<item>      Designates one item in a row of a table.  Used only when
              intervening spaces do not serve properly as natural
              field separaters.
<table>     Always a filled rectangular array.
<matrix>    Always a filled rectangular array.
<figure>    Just a place-holder.
<illust>    Illustration place-holder.  Seldom used.
<supr>      Supra.  The two parts of each such field
               are stacked, one over the other, *without* a
               horizontal bar between (as in a fraction).
               Used only in one entry, for a musical notation.
<musfig>    Music figure.  Ony in a note under the entry "Figure", 
               the two numbers of each such field
               are bold, 20 point type, stacked as in a fraction with
               a bar between them, but also having a horizontal stroke  
               midway through each numeral. Unique to this entry.

Functional Tags
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Tag        Font                        Meaning
                      (Comparatives are relative to the plain font.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<--    -->   *    Comment, not a tag.  These segments should be deleted
                     from the written or printed text.
                  Page numbers of the original text are indicated
                     within such comments;  these may be left in, if
                      desired.
<mhw>        *          Multiple headword.   This field is used where
                           more than one headword shares a single
                           definition.  In the dictionary, the
                           (usually) two headwords are left-justified
                           one below the other in the column, and are
                           tied together on the right side of the
                           headwords by a long right curly brace.
                              This division is strictly functional,
                           for analytical purposes, and does not
                           affect the typography.
<hw>       bold,         headword.  Each main entry begins with the <hw>
           larger by       mark, and ends at the next <hw> mark.  The
           2 points        main entries are not otherwise explicitly
                           marked as a distinctive field.
                              The same word may appear as a headword
                          several times, usually as different parts
                          of speech, but sometimes with diferent
                          entries as the same part of speech, presumably
                          to indicate a different etymology.
                              Within the hw field the heavy accent is
                           represented by double quote ("), the
                           light accent by open-single-quote (`),
                           and the short dash separating syllables by
                           an asterisk (*). A hyphen (-) is used to
                           represent the hyphen of hyphenated words.

<pr>        *           pronunciation.  The default font is normal, but
                           many non-ASCII characters are used.
                           The pronunciation field may have more than
                           one pronunciation, separated by an "<or/".
                           (An "or" here is in italic, and usually is
                           represented by the entity <or/).
                           There may also be some commentary, such as
                           "Fr."(French pronunciation) or "archaic".
                           The commentaries are typically italic, and
                           should be marked as such.  In certain
                           pronunciations there is a numbered reference
                           to a root form explained in an introductory
                           section on pronunciation.
                               Very few of the pronunciation fields have
                           been filled in.  The pronunciation markings use
                           a more complicated method than more modern
                           dictionaries.  It would be interesting to have
                           these fields filled in, if there are any
                           volunteers willing to do it.

<pos>       italic       Part of speech.  Always an abbreviation: e.g.,
                          n.; v. i.; v. t.; a.; adv.; pron.; prep.
                          Combinations may occur, as "a. & n.".

<plu>        *           Plural.  The "plural" segment starts with a
                           "pl." which is italicised, but in this
                           segment is not otherwise marked as
                           italicised.  Other words occurring in this
                           segment are plain type.  The "pl." can be
                           easily explicitly marked if necessary.

<plw>    small caps      Plural word.  The actual plural form of the word,
                            found within a <plu> segment.

<sing>      *            Singular. Analogous to the <plu> segment, but more
                            rarely used, mostly for Indian tribes.

<singw>  small caps     Singular word.  The singular form of the
                            plural-form  headword.

<wordforms>  *           Morphological derivatives.  In this position,
                           the various derivative forms of the verbs are
                           listed (imperfect, present progressive).
                           Adverbial and nominal derivatives of adjectives
                           are also marked as <wordforms>, but are found
                           at the end of each main entry.  Also, irregular
                           comparative and superlative derivatives of
                           adjectives may have a "wordforms" segment
                           prior to the definition.   In the case of
                           such wordforms prior to the definition, this
                           segment is almost always contained within square
                           brackets, with an occasional exception.  The
                           adverbial and nominalized derivatives at the end
                           of a main entry are usually introduced by an
                           em dash [represented as two hyphens (--)].

<wf>      bold,          Same font as <hw>, with accents and syllable
          larger by        breaks marked as in the headword.
          2 points

<er>      Small Caps     Entry reference.  References to headwords
                           within the "etymology" section are in small
                           caps, and so are the morphological derivatives
                           presented in the "wordforms" segment prior to
                           the definition.  Such references also occur
                           in the body of definitions, and in "usage"
                           segments.
                              The morphological derivatives (in the
                           <wordforms> segments) do not have entries
                           elsewhere, so "entry reference" is a
                           misleading tag in these
                           cases, where it merely signifies a font,
                           and should be changed in the next version.

                        Such entry referemces, other than in <wordforms>
                          segments, should function as hypertext buttons
                          to access that entry.

<ety>        *           Etymology.  Always contained within square
                           brackets.  Normal type is used for explanatory
                           comments, and italics for the actual words
                           (marked <ets>) considered as etymological
                           sources.

<ets>      italic        Etymological source.  Words from which the
                           headword was derived, or to which it is related.
                           The Greek words within an etymology segment
                           are invariably etymology sources, and should
                           be marked as such, but are not so marked,
                           even in the rare cases where the Greek word
                           transliteration has been written in.

<grk>   transliteration  Greek.  The Greek words have been transliterated
                             using the equivalents explained in the
                             file "entities.web".  In most cases, the
                             transliterations are typical for Greek
                             letters, except for theta (transl = q),
                             phi (transl. = f), eta (transl. = h), and
                             upsilon (transl. = y, whether pronounced
                             as y or u).  This was to eliminate any
                             ambiguity.

<sn>       bold,         Sense number.  A headword may have over 20
           larger by       different sense numbers.  Within each numbered
           2 points        sense there may be lettered sub-senses.  See
                           the <sd> (sub-definition) field.

<fld>     italic         Field of specialization.  Most often used for
                           Zoology and Botany, but many "fields of
                           specialization" are marked for technical
                           terms.  The parentheses are usually within this
                           field, but are not themselves in italics.

<def>       *           definition.  The definition may have subfields,
                            particularly <as> (an illustrative phrase
                            starting with "as" or "thus" and containing
                            the headword (or a morphological derivative).
                            The <mark>, \'bd...\'b8 quotations (left and
                            right double quotes) and <au> fields may be
                            found within a definition field, but should
                            and usually are located outside the definition
                            proper.  The marking macro was
                            inconsistent in this placement, and the
                            exclusion of the <mark>, <au> and quotations
                            needs to be completed by the proof-readers.
                                 Certain definitions contain <pos>
                           fields within them, where the headword is
                           an irregular derivative of another headword.
                           In these cases, the <pos> field follows
                           immediately after the <def> tag, and these
                           entries do not have a separate <pos> field.
                           In such cases, the <pos> field is italic, as
                           usual.

<au>    italic          Authority or author.  Used where an authority is
      (may be right-       given for a definition, and also used for the
       justified. See      author, where a quotation within double quotes
       in the section      is given in  the same paragraph as the
       on formatting).     definition.  The double quotes are indicated
                           by the open-quote (\'bd) and close-quote
                           (\'b8).   In both cases, it is typically
                           right-justified, almost always fitting on
                           the same line with the last line of the
                           definition or quotation.
                               Within collocation segments, it is usually
                           used only after quotations, and is not right-
                           justified, except occasionally where it
                           would be close to the right margin, and then
                           apparently is is right-justified.  We have
                           not explicitly marked those which are
                           right-justified, but they can be
                           recognized because they are on a line by
                           themselves, preceded by two carriage returns.

<q>     smaller by         Quotation.  No bracketing quotation marks,
        two points,          though occasionally \'bd-\'b8 quotations occur
         centered,           within these quotations.  These quotations
        Separate             tend to be more complete sentences, rather
         paragraph           than just phrases, such as are contained
                             within quotation marks within the definition
                             paragraph.

<qau>    italic,          Quotation author.  Used only for the quotations
       right justified       that are centered in their own paragraphs.

<qex>    italic           Quotation example.  An example of usage within
                            quotations marked <q>..</q>

<cs>   smaller spacing    Collocation segment. The font and size is
                            normal in a cs, but the spacing between lines
                            is smaller (0.9 mm between lower-case letters,
                            rather than 1.1 mm in the main body of the
                            definition).  For an on-line dictionary,
                            this typography is probably pointless.

<col>    bold,            Collocation.  A word combination containing the
         smaller by           headword (or a morphological derivative).
         1 point              The collocations do not have an explicitly
                           marked part of speech.

<mcol>     *              Multiple collocation.  Similar to multiple
                            headword, when two or more collocations share
                            one definition; however, the two collocations
                            are in-line, rather than stacked or justified.
                               There may be "or" or "and" words
                            (italicised), or an "etc." (plain type)
                            within this field.  In most cases, the
                            <or/ and <and/ entities are used to
                            signify the change of font for these words.

<cd>   smaller spacing  Collocation definition.  Similar in structure
                           to headword definitions (the <def> field).  May
                           contain an <as> field.  Plain type, but with
                           closer spacing than main definitions.

<note>    *              Explanatory note.  No explicit font is indicated.
                            These segments may be separate, as in the
                            separate paragraphs starting <note><hand/,
                            or they may just be further explanation within
                            (or more usually, following) the main
                            definition paragraph.

<altname>  italic        Alternative name.  Usually for plants or animals,
                           but also used for other cases where words
                           are introduced by "also called", "called also",
                           "formerly called".  These are functionally
                           synonyms for that word-sense.

<altnpluf> italic        Same as <altname>, but the marked word is a
                            plural form, whereas the headword is singular.

<mark>     italic,       Usage mark.  Almost always within square
                          brackets, occasionally in parentheses or
                          without any bracketing.
           but            The most common usage marks,
           explanatory    "Obs." = obsolete "R." = rare, "Colloq." =
           may be plain.   colloquial, "Prov. Eng." = Provincial England,
                           etc. are in italics.  Some usage notes are also
                          marked with <mark>, but are in plain.  For
                          simplicity, all words in this field may be
                          italic, until additional explicti marks are
                          added.

<as>        *           A segment occurring within the definitional
                          sentence, providing an example of usage of
                          the headword.  Not conceptually a part of the
                          actual definition.

<ex>      italic       Example.  An example of usage of the headword,
                          usually found within an <as> segment.

<altsp>    *          Alternative spelling segment.  Almost always
                         contained within square brackets after the main
                          definition segment.  Expository words
                          such as "Spelled also" are in plain font.

<asp>    italic      Alternative spelling.  The actual word which is an
                          alternative spelling to the headword.  These
                          are functionally synonyms of the headword.  In
                          most cases these also occur as headwords, with
                          reference to the word where the actual definition
                          is found, but no check has been performed to see
                          if they are all listed separately.  They should
                          be indexed at this location, also.

<cref>  italic     Collocation reference.  A reference to a collocation.
                        Each such collocation should have its own entry,
                        and these references should function as
                        hypertext buttons to access that entry.

<sd>    italic     Subdefinition, marked (a), (b), (c), etc.  THese are
                       finer distinctions of word senses, used
                       within numbered word-sense (for main entries),
                       and also used for subdefinitions within
                       collocation segments, which have no numbering of
                       senses.  The letter is italic, the parentheses
                       are not.

<syn>    plain      Synonyms.  A list of synonyms, sometimes followed
                       by a <usage> segment.

<usage>  narrower   Comparisons of word usage for words which are
         spacing      sometimes confused.  As with collocation segments,
                      font is plain, but spacing is smaller than
                      normal definition spacing.  This seems pointlessly
                      complicating for an on-line display.

<contr>   italic    Contrasting word.  Not exactly an antonym, which
                      is marked <ant>, but a contrasting word which is
                      often introduced as "opposite to" or "contrasts
                      with".

<ant>     italic     Antonym.

<def2>     *        Second definition (occasionally, a third definition is
                       present).  This is used where a second or third
                       part of speech with the same orthography is
                       placed under one headword.  Within this segment,
                       there will be a <pos> field, and sometimes
                       a <mark> and/or a quotation.

<pluf>   italic.   Plural form.
                      Used exclusively to mark the "pl." abbreviation,
                      which introduces a definition for the headword,
                      *when used in the plural form*.  Not related to
                      <plu>, which spells out the plural form, but does
                      define it.

<uex>    italic    Usage example.  Used only a few times, within
                       <usage> segments.

<stype>  italic    Subtype.  A functional mark, to point out words which
                      are conceptually subtypes of the headword.

<chform>  plain,   Chemical formula.  The letters are plain font,
         numbers     but the numbers are subscript.   This is mostly
         subscript   useful as a functional mark to pinpoint
                     chemicals.

<mathex> italic    Mathematical expression.  In this dictionary,
                     essentially all letters (used as variable labels)
                     in math expressions are in italic font.
                     The "+" and "-" may also appear typographically
                     different from elsewhere in the dictionary.

<ratio> italic    Also a mathematical expression, but the colon and
                     double colon may have a different typography
                     than usual., as in <ratio>a:b</ratio>

<singf> italic    Singular form.  Analogous to <pluf>, to define
                     the singular word where the headword is the
                     plural form.

<mord>    *       Morphological derivation.  Used to mark the
                     entry-reference portions of those
                     entries which are defined as morphological
                     derivatives (plural, p. p., imp.) of other
                     headwords.  Used just as an attempt to
                     mark and regularize the entry format.
                     May be ignored typographically.

<fract> a stack,  Fraction.  Used for non-numerical fractions
          with       which cannot be expressed as a <frac12/-style
        numerator    entity.  The forward slash "/" is to be
        horizontal   interpreted as a horizontal line separating
           and       the numerator and denominator.
       denominator

<exp>  superscript,  Exponential.  Used in mathematical expressions.
        smaller
         font.

<xlati> italic     Translation (of Greek) in the body of a definition.
                      Used only twice.

<colf>   bold,    Collocation font.  Same font as used in collocations.
        smaller      This is used only in the list of "un-" words not
        by 1 point   actually defined in the dictionary.  Probably could be
                     replaced by a segment mark for the entire list!

<fexp>    *        Functional expression (math).  The function names are
                     in plain type, the variables are italic.

<iref>   italic    Illustration reference.

<figref> italic    Figure reference.

<chreact>  *      Chemical reaction.  Similar to chemical formulas (which
                    are contained but not explicitly marked), with
                    some other symbols.

<ptcl>  italic    Verb Particle.  Only a few particles were actually
                    marked, but in a future version more may be.

<tabtitle> ?      Table Title.  Used only once.

<root>    *       Square root -- differs from the entity <root/,
                    which is a square root sign that does not extend
                    beyond the number following it.  The <root>
                    field has a bar over the expression within the field,
                    as well as the square root symbol preceding the 
                    expression in the field.  Used only once.

<vinc>    *      Vinculum.  In a mathematical expression, a bar
                    extending over the expression within the field.
                    Used only once.  This apparently serves the same
                    function as a parentheses, of causing the 
                    expression within the field to be evaluated
                    and the result used as the (mathematical) value 
                    of the field.

<nul>    plain   Nultype.  An older version of <plain>.

<part>  italic   Part.  A word which is a part of the headword.

<cd2>     *      Second collocation definition.  Somewhat similar to
                   <def2>.  Purely a mark to reduce functional ambiguity,
                   with no effect on the typography.

salts which effloresce in the form of a powder or crust (usually
white) in dry weather following rains or irrigation. The basis of
these salts is mainly soda with a smaller amount of potash, and
usually a little lime and  magnesia. Two main classes of alkali are
commonly distinguished: <i>black alkali</i>, which may be any alkaline
carbonate, but which practically consists of sodium carbonate (sal
soda), which is highly corrosive and destructive to vegetation; and
<i>white alkali</i>, characterized by the presence of sodium sulphate
(Glauber's salt), which is less injurious to vegetation. Black alkali
is so called because water containing it dissolves humus, forming a
dark-colored solution which, when it collects in puddles and
evaporates, produces characteristic black spots.</def></p>

live in barracks or cantonments when not in the field; (<i>2</i>) the
<i>reserves</i> of this army, in which the soldiers, while remaining
constantly subject to a call to the colors, live at their homes, being
summoned more or less frequently to report for instruction, drill, or
maneuvers; and (<i>3</i>) one or more classes of soldiers organized
largely for territorial defense, living at home and having only
occasional periods of drill and instraction, who are variously called
<i>home reserves</i> (as in the table below), <i>second</i>,
<i>third</i>, etc., <i>line of defense</i> (the regular army and its
reserves ordinarily constituting the <i>first line of defense</i>),
<i>territorial forces</i>, or the like. In countries where
conscription prevails a soldier is supposed to serve a given number of
years.  He is usually enrolled first in the regular army, then passes
to its reserve, then into the home reserves, to serve until he reaches
the age limit. It for any reason he is not enrolled in the regular
army, he may begin his service in the army reserves or even the home
reserves, but then serves the full number of years or up to the age
limit. In equipment the organization of the army is into the three
great arms of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, together with more or
less numerous other branches, such as engineers, medical corps, etc.,
besides the staff organizations such as those of the pay and
subsistence departments.</def></p>

America, including the Aleutian Islands, to the east of the line; and
between south latitudes 12&deg; and 56&deg;, so that Chatham Island
and the Tonga group lie to the west of it. A vessel crossing this line
to the westward sets the date forward by one day, as from Sunday to
Monday. A vessel crossing the line to the eastward sets the date back
by one day, as from Monday to Sunday. Hawaii has the same day name as
San Francisco; Manila, the same day name as Australia, and this is one
day later than the day of Hawaii. Thus when it is Monday May 1st at

<p><hw>Eastern Church</hw>. <def>That portion of the Christian church
which prevails in the countries once comprised in the Eastern Roman
Empire and the countries converted to Christianity by missionaries
from them. Its full official title is <i>The Orthodox Catholic
Apostolic Eastern Church</i>. It became estranged from the Western, or
Roman, Church over the question of papal supremacy and the doctrine of
the filioque, and a separation, begun in the latter part of the 9th
century, became final in 1054. The Eastern Church consists of twelve
(thirteen if the Bulgarian Church be included) mutually independent
churches (including among these the Hellenic Church, or Church of
Greece, and the Russian Church), using the vernacular (or some ancient
form of it) in divine service and varying in many points of detail,
but standing in full communion with each other and united as equals in
a great federation. The highest five authorities are the patriarch of
Constantinople, or ecumenical patriarch (whose position is not one of
supremacy, but of precedence), the patriarch of Alexandria, the
patriarch of Jerusalem, the patriarch of Antioch, and the Holy Synod
of Russia. The Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical
councils (and is hence styled only schismatic, not heretical, by the
Roman Catholic Church), has as its creed the Niceno-Constantinopolitan
(without the later addition of the filioque, which, with the doctrine
it represents, the church decisively rejects), baptizes infants with
trine immersion, makes confirmation follow immediately upon baptism,
administers the Communion in both kinds (using leavened bread) and to
infants as well as adults, permits its secular clergy to marry before
ordination and to keep their wives afterward, but not to marry a
second time, selects its bishops from the monastic clergy only,
recognizes the offices of bishop, priest, and deacon as the three
necessary degrees of orders, venerates relics and icons, and has an
elaborate ritual.</def></p>

<p><hw>E*lec"tron</hw> (?), [NL., fr. Gr. &?;. See <u>Electric</u>.]
<i>(Physics & Chem.)</i> <def>One of those particles, having about one
thousandth the mass of a hydrogen atom, which are projected from the
cathode of a vacuum tube as the cathode rays and from radioactive
substances as the beta rays; -- called also <i>corpuscle</i>. The
electron carries (or is) a natural unit of negative electricity, equal
to 3.4 x 10<sup>-10</sup> electrostatic units. It has been detected
only when in rapid motion; its mass, which is electromagnetic, is
practically constant at the lesser speeds, but increases as the
velocity approaches that of light. Electrons are all of one kind, so
far as known, and probably are the ultimate constituents of all atoms.
An atom from which an electron has been detached has a positive charge
and is called a <i>coelectron</i>.</def></p>

caused by a slipping of rock masses along a plane of facture; also,

<p>The surface along which the dislocated masses have moved is called
the <col><b>fault plane</b></col>. When this plane is vertical, the
fault is a <col><b>vertical fault</b></col>; when its inclination is
such that the present relative position of the two masses could have
been produced by the sliding down, along the fault plane, of the mass
on its upper side, the fault is a <col><b>normal</b></col>, or
<col><b>gravity</b></col>, <col><b>fault</b></col>. When the fault
plane is so inclined that the mass on its upper side has moved up
relatively, the fault is then called a <col><b>reverse</b></col> (or
<col><b>reversed</b></col>), <col><b>thrust</b></col>, or
<col><b>overthrust</b></col>, <col><b>fault</b></col>. If no vertical
displacement has resulted, the fault is then called a
<col><b>horizontal fault</b></col>. The linear extent of the
dislocation measured on the fault plane and in the direction of
movement is the <col><b>displacement</b></col>; the vertical
displacement is the <col><b>throw</b></col>; the horizontal
displacement is the <col><b>heave</b></col>. The direction of the line
of intersection of the fault plane with a horizontal plane is the
<col><b>trend</b></col> of the fault. A fault is a <col><b>strike
fault</b></col> when its trend coincides approximately with the strike
of associated strata (i.e., the line of intersection of the plane of
the strata with a horizontal plane); it is a <col><b>dip
fault</b></col> when its trend is at right angles to the strike; an
<col><b>oblique fault</b></col> when its trend is oblique to the
strike. Oblique faults and dip faults are sometimes called
<col><b>cross faults</b></col>. A series of closely associated
parallel faults are sometimes called <col><b>step faults</b></col> and

as in a steam-engine boiler. The gas used may be a fixed gas, or one
derived from alcohol, ether, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, oil

(2) engines using the vapor of a volatile fluid, as the typical

an atomized spray or the vapor (produced by heat) of a comparatively
heavy oil, as petroleum or kerosene. In all of these the gas is mixed

combustion engines use the Otto (four-stroke) cycle, though many use
the two-stroke cycle. They are almost universally trunk engines and
single-acting. Because of the intense heat produced by the frequent

anions toward the anode. This movement is called <b>migration</b>, and
the velocity of it differs for different kinds of ions. If the
electromotive force is sufficient, electrolysis ensues: cations give

fixed form from Hillel II. about 360 <u>a. d.</u> The present names of
the months, which are Babylonian-Assyrian in origin, replaced older
ones, <i>Abib</i>, <i>Bul</i>, etc., at the time of the Babylonian
Exile. Nineteen years constitute a lunar cycle, of which the 3d, 6th,
8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years are leap years. The year 5663
[1902-3 <u>a. d.</u>] was the first year of the 299th lunar cycle. The
common year is said to be <i>defective</i>, <i>regular</i>, or
<i>perfect</i> (or <i>abundant</i>) according as it has 353, 354, or
355 days. The leap year has an intercalary month, and a total of 383
(defective), 384 (regular), or 385 (perfect, or abundant) days. The
calendar is complicated by various rules providing for the harmonious
arrangement of festivals, etc., so that no simple perpetual calendar
can be constructed. The following table gives the months in order,
with the number of days assigned to each. Only three months vary in
length. They are: Heshvan, which has 30 days in perfect years; Kislev,
which has 30 days in regular and perfect years; and Adar, which has 30
days in leap years. The ecclesiastical year commences with Nisan and
the civil year with Tishri. The date of the first of Tishri, or the
Jewish New Year, is also given for the Jewish years 5661-5696 (1900-
1935 <u>a. d.</u>). From these tables it is possible to transform any
Jewish date into Christian, or vice versa, for the years 1900-1935

*In the self-governing colonies of Great Britain the legislative body
usually consists of two chambers, the names of the legislature and the
chambers varying.  Thus in Australia the Federal Parliament is
composed of the Senate and the House of Commons, in New Zealand the
General Assembly is composed of the Legislative Council and the House
of Representatives, etc.</p>

<p>#Members of the Storthing are chosen for three years by direct
election by manhood suffrage, forty-one being elected from the towns
and eighty-two from the rural districts.  The Storthing on assembling
divides into the Lagthing including one fourth and the Odelsthing
including three fourths of the total membership of the Storthing.  All
new laws are laid first before the Odelsthing.  If the two houses do
not agree they vote in joint session, a majority of two thirds of
those voting being necessary to a decision.</p>

in their adult condition live in the tissues of mosquitoes of the
genus <i>Anopheles</i> (which see) and when transferred to the blood
of man, by the bite of the mosquito, produce malaria.</def> The young
parasites, or <b>sporozoites</b>, enter the red blood corpuscles,
growing at their expense, undergoing sporulation, and finally
destroying the corpuscles, thus liberating in the blood plasma an
immense number of small spores called <b>merozoites</b>. An indefinite
but not ultimated number of such generations may follow, but if
meanwhile the host is bitten by a mosquito, the parasites develop into
gametes in the stomach of the insect. These conjugate, the zygote thus
produced divides, forming spores, and eventually sporozoites, which,
penetrating to the salivary glands of the mosquito, may be introduced
into a new host. The attacks of the disease coincide with the
dissolution of the corpuscles and liberation of the spores and
products of growth of the parasites into the blood plasma. Several
species of the parasite are distinguished, as <i>P. vivax</i>,
producing tertian malaria; <i>P. malari&aelig;</i>, quartan malaria;
and <i>P. (subgenus Laverania) falciferum</i>, the malarial fever of
summer and autumn common in the tropics.</p>

<p><hw>Mendelian character</hw>. <i>(Biol.)</i> <def>A character which
obeys Mendel's law in regard to its hereditary transmission.</def></p>

<p><hw>Men"del's law</hw> (?). <def>A principle governing the
inheritance of many characters in animals and plants, discovered by
Gregor J. Mendel (Austrian Augustinian abbot, 1822-84) in breeding
experiments with peas. He showed that the height, color, and other
characters depend on the presence of determinating factors behaving as
units. In any given germ cell each of these is either present or
absent.</def> The following example (using letters as symbols of the
determining factors and hence also of the individuals possessing them)
shows the operation of the law: Tallness being due to a factor
<i>T</i>, a tall plant, arising by the union in fertilization of two
germ cells both bearing this factor, is <i>TT</i>; a dwarf, being
without <i>T</i>, is <i>tt</i>. Crossing these, crossbreeds,
<i>Tt</i>, result (called generation <i>F</i><subs>1</subs>). In the
formation of the germ cells of these crossbreeds a process of
segregation occurs such that germ cells, whether male or female, are
produced of two kinds, <i>T</i> and <i>t</i>, in equal numbers. The
<i>T</i> cells bear the factor "tallness," the <i>t</i> cells are
devoid of it. The offspring, generation <i>F</i><subs>2</subs>, which
arise from the chance union of these germ cells in pairs, according to
the law of probability, are therefore on an average in the following
proportions:</p>

<p>1 <i>TT</i> : 2 <i>Tt</i> : 1 <i>tt</i>;</p>

<p>and thus plants pure in tallness (<i>TT</i>) and dwarfness
(<i>tt</i>), as well as crossbreeds (<i>Tt</i>), are formed by the
interbreeding of crossbreeds. Frequently, as in this example, owning
to what is called the <i>dominance</i> of a factor, the operation of
Mendel's law may be complicated by the fact that when a
<i>dominant</i> factor (as <i>T</i>) occurs with its allelomorph (as
<i>t</i>), called <i>recessive</i>, in the crossbreed <i>Tt</i>, the
individual <i>Tt</i> is itself indistinguishable from the pure form
<i>TT</i>. Generation <i>F</i><subs>1</subs>, containing only the
<i>Tt</i> form, consists entirely of dominants (tall plants) and
generation <i>F</i><subs>2</subs> consists of three dominants (2
<i>Tt</i>, 1 <i>TT</i>) to one dwarf (<i>tt</i>), which, displaying
the feature suppressed in <i>F</i><subs>1</subs>, is called
<i>recessive</i>. Such qualitative and numerical regularity has been
proved to exist in regard to very diverse qualities or characters
which compose living things, both wild and domesticated, such as
colors of flowers, of hair or eyes, patterns, structure, chemical
composition, and power of resisting certain diseases. The diversity of
forms produced in crossbreeding by horticulturists and fanciers
generally results from a process of analytical variation or
recombination of the factors composing the parental types. Purity of
type consequently acquires a specific meaning. An individual is pure
in respect of a given character when it results from the union of two
sexual cells both bearing that character, or both without it.</p>

Leading features are freedom for physical activity (no stationary
desks and chairs), informal and individual instruction, the very early
development of writing, and an extended sensory and motor training
(with special emphasis on vision, touch, perception of movement, and
their interconnections), mediated by a patented, standardized system
of "didactic apparatus," which is declared to be "auto-regulative."

carbohydrates are formed from water vapor and the carbon dioxide of
the air in the chlorophyll-containing tissues of plants exposed to the
action of light. It was formerly called <i>assimilation</i>, but this
is now commonly used as in animal physiology. The details of the
process are not yet clearly known. Baeyer's theory is that the carbon
dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide, which, uniting with the
hydrogen of the water in the cell, produces formaldehyde, the latter
forming various sugars through polymerization. Vines suggests that the
carbohydrates are secretion products of the chloroplasts, derived from
decomposition of previously formed proteids. The food substances are
usually quickly translocated, those that accumulate being changed to
starch, which appears in the cells almost simultaneously with the
sugars. The chloroplasts perform photosynthesis only in light and
within a certain range of temperature, varying according to climate.
This is the only way in which a plant is able to organize
carbohydrates. All plants without a chlorophyll apparatus, as the
fungi, must be parasitic or saprophytic.</def> --

<p><hw>Police power</hw>. <i>(Law)</i> <def>The inherent power of a

government, or the powers of government inherent in every sovereignty
to the extent of its dominions (11 Peters (<i>U. S.</i>) 102). The
later cases have excepted from its domain the development and
administration of private law. Modern political science defines the
power as a branch of internal administration in the exercise of which
the executive should move within the lines of general principles
prescribed by the constitution or the legislature, and in the exercise
of which the most local governmental organizations should participate
as far as possible (<i>Burgess</i>). Under this limitation the police
power, as affecting persons, is the power of the state to protect the
public against the abuse of individual liberty, that is, to restrain
the individual in the exercise of his rights when such exercise
becomes a danger to the community. The tendency of judicial and
popular usage is towards this narrower definition.</p>

<i>(Painting)</i> <def>In the broadest sense, the theory or practice
of any of several groups of recent painters, or of these groups taken
collectively, whose work and theories have in common a tendency to
reaction against the scientific and naturalistic character of
impressionism and neo-impressionism. In a strict sense the term post-
impressionism is used to denote the effort at self-expression, rather
than representation, shown in the work of C&eacute;zanne, Matisse,
etc.; but it is more broadly used to include <b>cubism</b>, the theory
or practice of a movement in both painting and  sculpture which lays
stress upon volume as the important attribute of objects and attempts
its expression by the use of geometrical figures or solids only; and
<b>futurism</b>, a theory or practice which attempts to place the
observer within the picture and to represent simultaneously a number
of consecutive movements and impressions. In practice these theories
and methods of the post-impressionists change with great rapidity and
shade into one another, so that a picture may be both cubist and
futurist in character. They tend to, and sometimes reach, a condition
in which both representation and traditional decoration are entirely
abolished and a work of art becomes a purely subjective expression in
an arbitrary and personal language.</def></p>

<i>radius</i> ray.] <i>(Chem.)</i> <def>An intensely radioactive
metallic element found (combined) in minute quantities in pitchblende,
and various other uranium minerals. Symbol, <i>Ra</i>; atomic weight,
226.4. Radium was discovered by M. and Mme. Curie, of Paris, who in
1902 separated compounds of it by a tedious process from pitchblende.
Its compounds color flames carmine and give a characteristic spectrum.
It resembles barium chemically. Radium preparations are remarkable for
maintaining themselves at a higher temperature than their
surroundings, and for their radiations, which are of three kinds:
<i>alpha rays</i>, <i>beta rays</i>, and <i>gamma rays</i> (see these
terms). By reason of these rays they ionize gases, affect photographic
plates, cause sores on the skin, and produce many other striking
effects. Their degree of activity depends on the proportion of radium
present, but not on its state of chemical combination or on external
conditions.The radioactivity of radium is therefore an atomic
property, and is explained as result from a disintegration of the
atom. This breaking up occurs in at least seven stages; the successive
main products have been studied and are called <col><b>radium
emanation</b></col> or <i>exradio</i>, <col><b>radium A</b></col>,
<col><b>radium B</b></col>, <col><b>radium C</b></col>, etc. (The
emanation is a heavy gas, the later products are solids.) These
products are regarded as unstable elements, each with an atomic weight
a little lower than its predecessor. It is possible that lead is the
stable end product. At the same time the light gas helium is formed;
it probably consists of the expelled alpha particles. The heat effect
mentioned above is ascribed to the impacts of these particles. Radium,
in turn, is believed to be formed indirectly by an immeasurably slow
disintegration of uranium.</def></p>

<def>The name applied by the Russian government to any subject of the

of the translation of the religious books. The dissenters, who have
been continually persecuted, are believed to number about 20,000,000,
although the Holy Synod officially puts the number at about 2,000,000.

<i>(Banking)</i> <def>Usually, the uninvested cash kept on hand for
this purpose, called the <i>real reserve</i>. In Great Britain the
ultimate <i>real reserve</i> is the gold kept on hand in the Bank of
England, largely represented by the notes in hand in its own banking
department; and any balance which a bank has with the Bank of England
is a part of its <i>reserve</i>. In the United States the reserve of a
national bank consists of the amount of lawful money it holds on hand
against deposits, which is required by law to be not less than 15 per
cent (<i>U. S. Rev. Stat. secs. 5191, 5192</i>), three fifths of which

company to have at any given time to enable it, with interest and
premiums paid as they shall accure, to meet all claims on the
insurance then in force as they would mature according to the
particular mortality table accepted. The reserve is always reckoned as
a liability, and is calculated on net premiums. It is theoretically
the difference between the present value of the total insurance and
the present value of the future premiums on the insurance. The
reserve, being an amount for which another company could,
theoretically, afford to take over the insurance, is sometimes called
the <col><b>reinsurance fund</b></col> or the <col><b>self-insurance
fund</b></col>. For the first year upon any policy the net premium is
called the <col><b>initial reserve</b></col>, and the balance left at
the end of the year including interest is the <col><b>terminal
reserve</b></col>. For subsequent years the <i>initial reserve</i> is
the net premium, if any, plus the terminal reserve of the previous
year. The portion of the reserve to be absorbed from the initial
reserve in any year in payment of losses is sometimes called the
<col><b>insurance reserve</b></col>, and the terminal reserve is then
called the <col><b>investment reserve</b></col>.</def></p>

<p><hw>Roman calendar</hw>. <def>The calendar of the ancient Romans,
from which our modern calendars are derived. It is said to have
consisted originally of ten months, <i>Martius</i>, <i>Aprilis</i>,
<i>Maius</i>, <i>Junius</i>, <i>Quintilis</i>, <i>Sextilis</i>,
September, October, November, and December, having a total of 304
days. Numa added two months, <i>Januarius</i> at the beginning of the
year, and <i>Februarius</i> at the end, making in all 355 days. He
also ordered an intercalary month, <i>Mercedinus</i>, to be inserted
every second year. Later the order of the months was changed so that
January should come before February. Through abuse of power by the
pontiffs to whose care it was committed, this calendar fell into
confusion. It was replaced by the Julian calendar. In designating the
days of the month, the Romans reckoned backward from three fixed
points, the <i>calends</i>, the <i>nones</i>, and the <i>ides</i>. The
calends were always the first day of the month. The ides fell on the
15th in March, May, July (Quintilis), and October, and on the 13th in
other months. The nones came on the eighth day (the <i>ninth</i>,
counting the ides) before the ides. Thus, Jan. 13 was called the ides
of January, Jan. 12, the day before the ides, and Jan. 11, the
<i>third</i> day before the ides (since the ides count as one), while
Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February.</def></p>

differentiation of its parts (root, stem, leaves, flowers, etc.); by
the extreme reduction of the gametophyte; and by the development of
seeds. All the Spermatophyta are heterosporous; fertilization of the
egg cell is either through a <col><b>pollen tube</b></col> emitted by

<p><hw>Tur"bine</hw> (?), <pos><i>n.</i></pos> <def>A form of steam
engine analogous in construction and action to the water turbine.
There are practically only two distinct kinds, and they are typified
in the de Laval and the Parsons and Curtis turbines. The <col><b>de
Laval turbine</b></col> is an impulse turbine, in which steam impinges
upon revolving blades from a flared nozzle. The flare of the nozzle
causes expansion of the steam, and hence changes its pressure energy
into kinetic energy. An enormous velocity (30,000 revolutions per
minute in the 5 H. P. size) is requisite for high efficiency, and the
machine has therefore to be geared down to be of practical use. Some
recent development of this type include turbines formed of several de
Laval elements compounded as in the ordinary expansion engine. The
<col><b>Parsons turbine</b></col> is an impulse-and-reaction turbine,
usually of the axial type. The steam is constrained to pass
successively through alternate rows of fixed and moving blades, being
expanded down to a condenser pressure of about 1 lb. per square inch
absolute. The <col><b>Curtis turbine</b></col> is somewhat simpler
than the Parsons, and consists of elements each of which has at least
two rows of moving blades and one row of stationary. The bucket
velocity is lowered by fractional velocity reduction. Both the Parsons
and Curtis turbines are suitable for driving dynamos and steamships
directly. In efficiency, lightness, and bulk for a given power, they
compare favorably with reciprocating engines.</def></p>

The various styles of wrestling differ in their definition of a fall
and in the governing rules. In <col><b>Greco-Roman
wrestling</b></col>, tripping and taking hold of the legs are
forbidden, and a fall is gained (that is, the bout is won), by the
contestant who pins both his opponent's shoulders to the ground. In
<col><b>catch-as-catch-can wrestling</b></col>, all holds are
permitted except such as may be barred by mutual consent, and a fall
is defined as in Greco-Roman style. <col><b>Lancashire style
wrestling</b></col> is essentially the same as <i>catch-as-catch-
can</i>. In <col><b>Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling</b></col> the
contestants stand chest to chest, grasping each other around the body.
The one first losing his hold, or touching the ground with any part of
his body except his feet, loses the bout. If both fall to the ground
at the same time, it is a <i>dogfall</i>, and must be wrestled over.
In the <col><b>Cornwall and Devon wrestling</b></col>, the wrestlers
complete in strong loose linen jackets, catching hold of the jacket,
or anywhere above the waist. Two shoulders and one hip, or two hips
and one shoulder, must touch the ground to constitute a fall, and if a
man is thrown otherwise than on his back the contestants get upon
their feet and the bout recommences.</p>
