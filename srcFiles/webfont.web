    This file describes a modified font for use in visualizing the
text of the 1913 "Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary" (W1913),
usable for the DOS operating system of IBM-compatible personal computers.
The electronic version of that dictionary and this font were prepared by
MICRA, Inc., Plainfield NJ, and are copyrighted (C) 1996 by MICRA, Inc.
For details of permissions and restrictions on using these files, see
the accompanying file "readme.web".
    The special characters used in the electronic version of the Webster
1913 are required for visualizing unusual characters used in the
etymology and pronunciation fields of the dictionary, in a form
comparable to the way they appear in the original.  Since there are
more than 256 characters used in that dictionary, not all can be
represented by single-byte codes, and are instead represented by
SGML-style "short-form" symbols.  (rather than the "entity" format
"&xx;"  The ampersand is used frequently, and we prefer to leave
the "<" as the only "escape" character) of the type <x/ where x
is a specific code for the symbol in the dictionary.
See the "Short Form" section below for details about such characters.
Note that the symbols used here are in some cases abbreviations
(for compactness) of the ISO 8879 recommended symbols.  If necessary,
the table below allows simple replacement by alternate encodings.
    This symbol font can be loaded in IBM-compatible (x86) computers
running the DOS operating system by using the "font.bat" command file
in the "utils" directory.  The fonts files for 8x14 and 8x16 fonts are
"web14.fnt" and "web16.fnt" respectively.
    For those loading the Webster onto some machine other than an
IBM-compatible running DOS, it will be necessary to provide a
translation table, to convert these characters into a code that
can be handled by that computer.  For this reason, I attach an
"explanation" for each character, for those who cannot view
the original DOS font.
    The DOS-loadable font does not contain all of the characters needed
to depict the etymologies or the pronunciations.  In addition to an
absence of several characters used in the pronunciations, no Greek letters are
included.  The Greek words appearing in the etymologies,
when they are included, will be typed in a
roman-letter transcription (See section on Greek transcription, below).
Only a very few Greek words have been thus transcribed as of the
present version (version 0.41).
    Wherever the typists did not know the character to use, they
usually inserted a reverse-video question mark (decimal 176).
This appears in full-ASCII versions as <?/.  This mark was used both for
characters in non-ASCII fonts, and for unreadable characters (i.e.,
characters smeared in the original or distorted in the copies available
to the typists. The type in the original was in many places smeared and
illegible at the left and right page margins; occasionally, small
parts of words were blotted out by plain white space).
    A character table for the high-order characters appears below.
Under that is a list and description of most of the special characters
used in the Webster files.
     Note that there are yet some characters used in the etymologies,
and some other symbols, which are not in this list.  For example, the
vowels with a double dot *underneath*, e.g. a (as in all) have no representation
in this character set, and, where explicitly entered in the dictionary,
are represented by <xdd/ where "x" is the letter, as in "<add/".

ITALICS
-------
   In most places, italic font is represented by the tags <it>...</it>
surrounding the italic text, or by some other tag which also implies
italic font.  In the pronunciations, however, where italicized vowels 
are used among non-italic and other special characters to indicate
pronunciation, the special codes <ait/, <eit/, <iit/, <oit/, <uit/, 
are also used to indicate the italicized vowel.

DIACRITICS
-------------
     The European grave and acute accents are represented by the
standard (IBM PC) high-order codes.  Other characters with diacritics
are represented by special "entity" codes, and in some cases also
are found in this special WEB1913 font, described below.
     Vowels with a circle above (as in Swedish) are coded <xring/
(x with a ring, or "degrees" mark over it); vowels with tilde over them
are represented by <xtil/, where "x" is the vowel, as in <etil/ (<atil/
also has code 238); letters with a dot above are represented by <xdot/
-- letter with a dot below are represented by <xsdot/ ("subdot");
vowels with the semi-long mark (a macron with a short perpendicular
vertical stroke attached above) are represented by <xsl/; the
circumflex vowels have codes on this list, but may also be represented
as <xcir/; vowels with macrons above are <xmac/ (including <oomac/,
the "oo" with an unbroken macron above the two letters, <aemac/ = the
ligature ae with a macron [also 214 = \'d6], and <oemac/ the ligature
oe with a macron [also 215 = \'d7]); vowels with umlauts or a crescent
(breve) above have codes in this list, but may also be represented by
<xum/ and <xcr/ respectively.  There is an occasional hacek or caron mark
(an inverted circumflex) in the original; such letters are coded <xcar/.
The o with a caron has code 213, but no others are in this font list.
The diaeresis is treated typographically as identical to the umlaut.
   A special modification, used only for poetry (see entry "saturnian verse"
under "saturnian") is a vowel with a macron, in which the macron is lighter
than the usual macron, signifying a stressed syllable which has a short
vowel sound.  This is represented by <xsmac/ ("short mac").
   Another special character used in pronunciations is an "n" with an underline (like
a macron, but below the letter), used to represent the "ng" sound.  This is coded
<nsm/ ("n sub-macron").  The ligated th used in pronunciations to depict the
"th" sound of "the" is coded as <th/.
    NOTE: the letter combinations "fi" and "fl" are invariably printed as the
ligatures &filig; and &fllig;, but these ligatures are not marked as such
in this transcription, and the two letters are left as individuals.

SPECIAL SYMBOLS
   The dagger <dag/, double dagger <ddag/, and paragraph mark <para/ are rarely used.
    The double prime, or "seconds" of a degree is sometimes represented by
a double "light accent" (code 183 = \'b7).  In other places, and in later
versions, it is represented by <sec/ = hex a9, in the webfont.
   The symbols "greater than" <gt/ and "less than" are encountered only
once, but are distinguished from the right- and left-angle brackets
(> and <) because of possible typographical differences in some fonts.
   The schwa is symbolized by <schwa/.  It is not used in the 
pronunciations, but is mentioned as a symbol.
   The right-pointing arrow is <rarr/, consistent with ISO 8879.

Below is a complete list of the symbols used in the Webster ("webfont") 
which are encoded in the special font listed above, together with
corresponding symbols in ISO 8879 and Tex coding.  Much of this table was
prepared by Rik Faith, to whom we express our appreciation.
    The "nearest ASCII" equivalents are given for those who want to
display the data as best one can in 7-bit simple ASCII symbols without
using the "entity" symbols.
=========================================================================
----------------------------------
Table 2     
----------------------------------

Comments: 
  (1) The symbol in the "entity" column is the SGML-like symbol used in
      the present Webster files; the symbol in the "ISO 8879" column is
      the symbol for the same character given in "The user's guide to
      ISO 8879" by Smith and Stutely.
  (2) An asterisk "*" in the "entity" column means that this symbol and 
code value is not used in any form in the Webster 1913 electronic version.
  (3)  If no asterisk is in the "entity" column, and no other symbol is 
there, this means that in the Webster, only the hexadecimal representation
was used (e.g. for \'d8, \'bd, and  \'b8).
  (4) \'b6 and \'b7, the heavy and light "accents", are never above a
letter (these are not diacritical marks), but in-between letters, as the
stress accent used in the headwords and pronunciations.  The accent
*follows* the syllable accented.  The light accent \'b7 is also used as
the "prime" in mathematical expressions (e.g. a\'b7 = "a prime"), or as
 "minutes" in degrees-minutes-seconds, and when doubled (\'b7\'b7)
serves as "double prime" in mathematical expressions, and as "seconds"
in degrees-minutes-seconds.  The character \'a9 (<sec/ or &Prime;) is
also used to represent the double prime.
  (5) Although the semilong vowels are in the table (e.g. the "asl" 
= "a semilong", most of the entries in the ASCII version dictionary
use the <xsl/ symbol coding.  If you know of any printers' names for
these, do let me know.
  (6)  For some reason, the a breve and u breve have ISO codes (in the
Latin-2 table), but the other vowels don't, in the Smith & Stutely book.
Is this a mistake?
  (7) The symbol <nsc/ is used for "N small capitals", used in
pronunciations to represent the soun fo the nasal N in French words.
  (8) A weak accent (when not in pronunciations) is symbolized by <prime/, the "minutes" (of a degree) symbol.  A strong accent is symbolized by <bprime/ ("bold prime", not an ISO entity).
  (9) If you find any exceptions to these usage assertions, please
let me know.

  183    b7      ·     light accent in headwords
                       replaced within headwords in the full ASCII version
                       by an open-single-quote (` = ASCII 96, not the same
                       as 191, \'bf).   This mark is used also
                       for minutes of a degree, and for "prime"
                       to modify variables in mathematical expressions.
                         -- two of these in sequence represent seconds

                       anglicization from a foreign language

  196    c4      Ä     graphic horizontal line
  195+208        ÃÐ     combination for a very long dash.  In the
                        original typing, the dash char 208 was used
                        for both non-breaking hyphen (in hyphenated
                        words), and for the em-dash used as an
                        introductory mark for various segments.
                        The em-dash should be distinguished from
                        the hyphen, but that conversion hasn't yet
                        been done.
                         In the full ASCII version, a double hypen

  197    c5      Å     <th/ (part 1) first of a pair of characters
     197+231 = Åç        used to represent the th ligature --
                         <th/ represents the "th" sound of "mother"

  207    cf      Ï     short dash, used in hyphenated words, and in
                         breaking syllables where no accent is used. But
                         sometimes the typists used the normal hyphen [45],
                         or the long dash (decimal 208) for that purpose.
                         The normal hyphen is the same length as the long
                         dash, but one pixel higher in the character box.
                         # In headwords, in the full ASCII version, this
                         short dash is represented by the asterisk "*".
  208    d0      Ð     <mdash/ = represents the long dash, used for the em 
                         dash which often precedes certain sections within a
                         definition, and which separates some sections,
                         such as wordforms or collocations within a
                         collocation segment.  This is replaced in the
                         full ASCII version by a double hyphen, "--".

                       length is the graphics character 186)
                       This precedes words marked with a double vertical bar in
                       the original dictionary, signifying that the word was
                       adopted directly into English without modification of
                       the spelling.

======================================
   Greek transcription
=====================================
Greek letters are represented:
   (capitals represent capital letters; lower-case represent lower-case)
   #Note that "h" in transliterations is used individually, as eta, and
   also in the combination "ch" (chi).  Conversions to other codings
   must first convert "ch" before converting "h", or at least verify
   that an "h" to be converted has no preceding "c".  "c" is not
   otherwise used, so there is no ambiguity.  Also, "ps" always
   represents a psi; it could in theory occur as a pi-sigma
   combination, but it doesn't.  Occasionally, "th" was entered instead
   of "q" to represent theta; these should be checked to verify that
   they do not represent tau-eta, and converted to "q".

(1) characters individually:
  By the short-form notation <alpha/, <beta/, <gamma/, <lambda/ etc.
  Capitalized letters are <ALPHA/, etc.
(2) in words:
 By inclusion within the markers <grk></grk>, using the following
  roman-letter equivalents for the Greek letters:
   Accents:
     (a) aspirants -- used in front of the letter modified, which is
usually in *front* of words beginning in vowels.  Of two types:
     ' (apostrophe) for the left-curving apirant (spiritus lenis)
     " (double quote) for the right-curving aspirant (spiritus asper)
       (when the aspirant is on a letter inside a word, it is placed
          in front of the letter it modifies.)
      (the left-curving aspirant is also used over rho, which is
        then usually transliterated "rh".  The " in such cases is
        placed in front of the r (for rho) which it modifies).
     (b) normal accent (appearing as an acute accent in the original):
          `  (left open quote, ASCII ) -- placed after accented vowel
     (b) grave accent (appearing as an grave accent in the original):
          ~  (tilde, ASCII ) -- placed after accented vowel.  This is
          rarely seen, as in <grk>to~ pa^n</grk> at "universe" or
          <grk>ta~ gewrgika`</grk> (at "Georgic").
     (c) curving accent (appearing as a rounded circumflex):
          ^  (circumflex) -- placed after accented vowel
     (d) "iota" subscript (ogonek)-- a comma placed after the vowel
               having the subscript
     (e) diaeresis:
         the double dot found occasionally over the iota is
         represented by a colon immediately after the iota,
         as the i-diaeresis in <grk>Farisai:ko`s</grk> (at "pharisaic").

     Where a letter has two accents, both are placed *after* the vowel
     Letters with an aspirant and an accent have the
         aspirant before the letter, and the accent after it.
