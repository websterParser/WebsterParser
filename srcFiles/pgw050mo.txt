The Project Gutenberg Etext of The 1913 Webster Unabridged Dictionary
******This file should be named pgw050mo.txt or pgw050mo.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, pgw051mo.txt

This etext was prepared by MICRA, INc. of Plainfield, NJ.  See below
for contact information.  Portions of the text have been proof-read 
and supplemented by volunteers, who have helped greatly to
improve the accuracy of this electronic version.

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do usually do NOT! keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

We need your donations more than ever!


All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
Mellon University).

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon
     University" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution
you can think of.  Money should be paid to "Project Gutenberg
Association / Carnegie-Mellon University".

<p>&fist; The term <i>machine</i> is most commonly applied to such
pieces of mechanism as are used in the industrial arts, for
mechanically shaping, dressing, and combining materials for various
purposes, as in the manufacture of cloth, etc. Where the effect is
chemical, or other than mechanical, the contrivance is usually
denominated an <i>apparatus</i>, not a machine; as, a <i>bleaching
apparatus</i>. Many large, powerful, or specially important pieces of
mechanism are called <i>engines</i>; as, a <i>steam engine</i>,
<i>fire engine</i>, <i>graduating engine</i>, etc.  Although there is
no well-settled distinction between the terms <i>engine</i> and
machine among practical men, there is a tendency to restrict the
application of the former to contrivances in which the operating part
is not distinct from the motor.</p>

<p><b>Syn.</b> -- <u>Memory</u>, <u>Remembrance</u>,
<u>Recollection</u>, <u>Reminiscence</u>.  <i>Memory</i> is the
generic term, denoting the power by which we reproduce past
impressions. <i>Remembrance</i> is an exercise of that power when
things occur <i>spontaneously</i> to our thoughts. In
<i>recollection</i> we make a distinct effort to <i>collect
again</i>, or call back, what we know has been formerly in the mind.
<i>Reminiscence</i> is intermediate between <i>remembrance</i> and
<i>recollection</i>, being a conscious process of recalling past
occurrences, but without that full and varied reference to particular
things which characterizes <i>recollection</i>. "When an idea again
recurs without the operation of the like object on the external
sensory, it is <i>remembrance</i>; if it be sought after by the mind,
and with pain and endeavor found, and brought again into view, it is
<i>recollection</i>."  <i>Locke.</i>

<p>&fist; As a rule, in the old English law, offenses capitally
punishable were felonies; all other indictable offenses were
misdemeanors. In common usage, the word <i>crime</i> is employed to
denote the offenses of a deeper and more atrocious dye, while small
faults and omissions of less consequence are comprised under the
gentler name of <i>misdemeanors</i>.  <i>Blackstone.</i><BR>
<BR>
   The distinction, however, between felonies and misdemeanors is
purely arbitrary, and is in most jurisdictions either abrogated or so
far reduced as to be without practical value.  Cf. <u>Felony</u>.

<p>&fist; The word <i>multiplication</i> is sometimes used in

of the fat, are mostly under the control of the will, or
<i>voluntary</i>, and are made up of great numbers of elongated
fibres bound together into bundles and inclosed in a sheath of
connective tissue, the <i>perimysium</i>. Each fiber is inclosed in a
delicate membrane (the <i>sarcolemma</i>), is made up of alternate
segments of lighter and darker material which give it a transversely
striated appearance, and contains, scattered through its substance,
protoplasmic nuclei, the so-called <i>muscle corpuscles</i>.</p>

<p>   The nonstriated muscles are <i>involuntary</i>. They constitute
a large part of the walls of the alimentary canal, blood vessels,
uterus, and bladder, and are found also in the iris, skin, etc. They

<p><hw>N</hw> (&ebreve;n), <def>the fourteenth letter of English
alphabet, is a vocal consonent, and, in allusion to its mode of
formation, is called the <i>dentinasal</i> or <i>linguanasal</i>

<i>done</i>; but when immediately followed in the same word by the
sound of <i>g</i> hard or <i>k</i> (as in <i>single</i>, <i>sink</i>,
<i>conquer</i>), it usually represents the same sound as the digraph
<i>ng</i> in <i>sing</i>, <i>bring</i>, etc. This is a simple but

water to and from the gill cavity, which contains two pairs of gills.

<p><b>Syn.</b> -- Noxious; unwholesome; insalubrious; mischievous;
destructive.  -- <u>Noisome</u>, <u>Noxious</u>. These words have to
a great extent been interchanged; but there is a tendency to make a
distinction between them, applying <i>noxious</i> to things that
inflict evil directly; as, a <i>noxious</i> plant, <i>noxious</i>
practices, etc., and <i>noisome</i> to things that operate with a
remoter influence; as, <i>noisome</i> vapors, a <i>noisome</i>
pestilence, etc. <i>Noisome</i> has the additional sense of
<i>disqusting</i>.  A garden may be free from <i>noxious</i> weeds or
animals; but, if recently covered with manure, it may be filled with
a <i>noisome</i> smell.</p>

<i>Dr. H. More.</i></p>

<p>&fist; <i>Notwithstanding</i> was, by Johnson and Webster, viewed
as a participle absolute, an English equivalent of the Latin <i>non
obstante</i>. Its several meanings, either as preposition, adverb, or
conjunction, are capable of being explained in this view. Later
grammarians, while admitting that the word was originally a
participle, and can be treated as such, prefer to class it as a
preposition or disjunctive conjunction.</p>

<p><b>Syn.</b> -- In spite of; despite.  -- <u>Notwithstanding</u>,
<u>In spite of</u>, <u>Despite</u>. These words and phrases are often
interchanged, but there is a difference between them, chiefly in
strength. <i>Notwithstanding</i> is the weaker term, and simply
points to some obstacle that may exist; as, I shall go,
<i>notwithstanding</i> the rain. <i>In spite</i> or <i>despite of</i>
has reference primarily to active opposition to be encountered from
others; as, "I'll be, in man's <i>despite</i>, a monarch; " "I'll
keep mine own, <i>despite of</i> all the world." <i>Shak.</i> Hence,
these words, when applied to <i>things</i>, suppose greater
opposition than <i>notwithstanding</i>. We should say. "He was thrust
rudely out of doors <i>in spite of</i> his entreaties," rather than
"<i>notwithstanding</i>". On the other hand, it would be more civil
to say, "<i>Notwithstanding</i> all you have said, I must still
differ with you."</p>

should be used in exclamations where no direct appeal or address to
an object is made, and may be followed by the exclamation point or
not, according to the nature or construction of the sentence. Some
insist that <i>oh</i> should be used only as an interjection
expressing strong feeling. The form <i>O</i>, however, is, it seems,
the one most commonly employed for both uses by modern writers and
correctors for the press. "<i>O</i>, I am slain !" <i>Shak.</i>

<p><blockquote>In the Middle Ages, <i>subject</i> meant
<i>substance</i>, and has this sense in Descartes and Spinoza:
sometimes, also, in Reid. <i>Subjective</i> is used by William of
Occam to denote that which exists independent of mind;
<i>objective</i>, what is formed by the mind. This shows what is
meant by <i>realitas objectiva</i> in Descartes. Kant and Fichte have
inverted the meanings. <i>Subject</i>, with them, is the mind which
knows; <i>object</i>, that which is known; <i>subjective</i>, the
varying conditions of the knowing mind; <i>objective</i>, that which
is in the constant nature of the thing known.</blockquote>
<i>Trendelenburg.</i></p>

<p><blockquote><i>Objective</i> means that which belongs to, or
proceeds from, the object known, and not from the subject knowing,
and thus denotes what is real, in opposition to that which is ideal -
- what exists in nature, in contrast to what exists merely in the
thought of the individual.</blockquote> <i>Sir. W. Hamilton.</i></p>

<p><blockquote><i>Objective</i> has come to mean that which has
independent exostence or authority, apart from our experience or
thought. Thus, moral law is said to have <i>objective authority</i>,
that is, authority belonging to itself, and not drawn from anything
in our nature.</blockquote> <i>Calderwood (Fleming's

<i>Objective</i> is applied to things exterior to the mind, and
<i>objects</i> of its attention; <i>subjective</i>, to the operations
of the mind itself. Hence, an <i>objective</i> motive is some outward
thing awakening desire; a <i>subjective</i> motive is some internal
feeling or propensity. <i>Objective</i> views are those governed by
outward things; <i>subjective</i> views are produced or modified by
internal feeling.  Sir Walter Scott's poetry is chiefly
<i>objective</i>; that of Wordsworth is eminently
<i>subjective</i>.</p>

<i>observe</i> means (1) to keep strictly; as, to <i>observe</i> a

with strictness; (2) to consider attentively, or to remark; and
hence, <i>observation</i> denotes either the act of <i>observing</i>,
or some remark made as the result thereof. We do not say the

<p><b>Syn.</b> -- To attain; gain; procure; acquire; win; earn.  See
<u>Attain</u>. -- To <u>Obtain</u>, <u>Get</u>, <u>Gain</u>,
<u>Earn</u>, <u>Acquire</u>. The idea of <i>getting</i> is common to
all these terms. We may, indeed, with only a slight change of sense,
substitute <i>get</i> for either of them; as, to <i>get</i> or to
<i>gain</i> a prize; to <i>get</i> or to <i>obtain</i> an employment;
to <i>get</i> or to <i>earn</i> a living; to <i>get</i> or to
<i>acquire</i> a language. To <i>gain</i> is to get by striving; and
as this is often a part of our good fortune, the word <i>gain</i> is
peculiarly applicable to whatever comes to us fortuitously. Thus, we
<i>gain</i> a victory, we <i>gain</i> a cause, we <i>gain</i> an
advantage, etc. To <i>earn</i> is to deserve by labor or service; as,
to <i>earn</i> good wages; to <i>earn</i> a triumph. Unfortunately,
one does not always <i>get</i> or <i>obtain</i> what he has
<i>earned</i>. To <i>obtain</i> implies desire for possession, and
some effort directed to the attainment of that which is not
immediately within our reach. Whatever we thus <i>seek</i> and
<i>get</i>, we <i>obtain</i>, whether by our own exertions or those
of others; whether by good or bad means; whether permanently, or only
for a time. Thus, a man <i>obtains</i> an employment; he
<i>obtains</i> an answer to a letter, etc. To <i>acquire</i> is more
limited and specific. We <i>acquire</i> what comes to us gradually in
the regular exercise of our abilities, while we <i>obtain</i> what
comes in any way, provided we desire it. Thus, we <i>acquire</i>
knowledge, property, honor, reputation, etc. What we <i>acquire</i>
becomes, to a great extent, permanently our own; as, to
<i>acquire</i> a language; to <i>acquire</i> habits of industry,
etc.</p>

application; as, a man <i>of</i> genius; a man <i>of</i> rare

figure; he lost all hope <i>of</i> relief; an affair <i>of</i> the

<i>of</i> corn? In these and similar phrases, <i>of</i> denotes
property or possession, or a relation of some sort involving
connection. These applications, however all proceeded from the same
primary sense. That which proceeds from, or is produced by, a person
or thing, either has had, or still has, a close connection with the
same; and hence the word was applied to cases of mere connection, not
involving at all the idea of separation.</p>

<p>&fist; The mineral oils are varieties of petroleum. See
<u>Petroleum</u>. The vegetable oils are of two classes, <i>essential
oils</i> (see under <u>Essential</u>), and <i>natural oils</i> which
in general resemble the animal oils and fats. Most of the natural
oils and the animal oils and fats consist of ethereal salts of
glycerin, with a large number of organic acids, principally stearic,
oleic, and palmitic, forming respectively stearin, olein, and
palmitin. Stearin and palmitin prevail in the solid oils and fats,
and olein in the liquid oils. Mutton tallow, beef tallow, and lard
are rich in stearin, human fat and palm oil in palmitin, and sperm
and cod-liver oils in olein. In making soaps, the acids leave the
glycerin and unite with the soda or potash.</p>

<p>&fist; In England <i>ordeal by fire</i> and <i>ordeal by water</i>
were used, the former confined to persons of rank, the latter to the
common people. The ordeal by fire was performed, either by handling
red-hot iron, or by walking barefoot and blindfold over red-hot
plowshares, laid at unequal distances. If the person escaped unhurt,
he was adjudged innocent; otherwise he was condemned as guilty. The
ordeal by water was performed, either by plunging the bare arm to the
elbow in boiling water, an escape from injury being taken as proof of
innocence, or by casting the accused person, bound hand and foot,
into a river or pond, when if he floated it was an evidence of guilt,
but if he sunk he was acquitted. It is probable that the proverbial
phrase, <i>to go through fire and water</i>, denoting severe trial or
danger, is derived from the ordeal. See <i>Wager of battle</i>, under

<p><blockquote>He saluted me on both cheeks in the <i>orthodox</i>

<p>&fist; The term <i>orthodox</i> differs in its use among the
various Christian communions. The Greek Church styles itself the
"Holy <i>Orthodox</i> Apostolic Church," regarding all other bodies
of Christians as more or less heterodox. The Roman Catholic Church
regards the Protestant churches as heterodox in many points. In the
United States the term <i>orthodox</i> is frequently used with
reference to divergent views on the doctrine of the Trinity. Thus it
has been common to speak of the Trinitarian Congregational churches
in distinction from the Unitarian, as <i>Orthodox</i>. The name is
also applied to the conservative, in distinction from the "liberal",
or Hicksite, body in the Society of Friends.  <i>Schaff-Herzog

<p><sn><b>1.</b></sn> <i>(Chem.)</i> <def>A colorless, tasteless,
odorless, gaseous element occurring in the free state in the
atmosphere, of which it forms about 23 per cent by weight and about
21 per cent by volume, being slightly heavier than nitrogen. Symbol
O. Atomic weight 15.96.</def></p>

<p>&fist; It occurs combined in immense quantities, forming eight
ninths by weight of water, and probably one half by weight of the
entire solid crust of the globe, being an ingredient of silica, the
silicates, sulphates, carbonates, nitrates, etc. Oxygen combines with
all elements (except fluorine), forming oxides, bases, oxyacid
anhydrides, etc., the process in general being called
<i>oxidation</i>, of which <i>combustion</i> is only an intense
modification. At ordinary temperatures with most substances it is
moderately active, but at higher temperatures it is one of the most
violent and powerful chemical agents known. It is indispensable in
respiration, and in general is the most universally active and
efficient element. It may be prepared in the pure state by heating
potassium chlorate.</p>

<p>    This element (called <i>dephlogisticated air</i> by Priestley)
was named <i>oxygen</i> by Lavoisier because he supposed it to be a
constituent of all acids. This is not so in the case of a very few
acids (as <i>hydrochloric</i>, <i>hydrobromic</i>, <i>hydric
sulphide</i>, etc.), but these do contain elements analogous to
oxygen in property and action. Moreover, the fact that most elements
approach the nearer to <i>acid</i> qualities in proportion as they
are combined with more oxygen, shows the great accuracy and breadth
of Lavoisier's conception of its nature.</p>
